Hi! I am a second-year PhD student at PAttern Recognition and NEural Computing (PARNEC) group, NUAA where I am fortunate enough to be advised by Prof. Songcan Chen who is also the leader of PARNEC group.

My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, especially Continual Learning Theory and Weakly Supervised Learning – check my publications or CV (PDF) for more information. I am open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!
